### How to Overcome Social Anxiety

Let's say you're socially anxious. Okay. So what happens when you are going to a party? Your heart is beating. Why?  The party is a monster because it's judging you, and it's putting you low down in the dominance hierarchy. Because that's a negative judgment, and that interferes with your sexual success and that means that you're being harshly evaluated by nature itself. Right?  So you are confronting the dragon of chaos when you go into the social situation and so

What you do with socially anxious people is to say: look at other people, look at them. Right? Why? Because if you look at them, you can tell what they're thinking. Anxious  people can usually talk quite well to someone one-on-one. Why?  Because they look at them.

Another thing to do, if you ever speak to a group of people, do not talk to the group.  Talk to individuals and then they reflect for you the entire group. Look at one person this person will broadcast to you what everyone's thinking. You know how to talk to one person, so it's easy as soon as you focus on the person. Use your eyes to push your attention outward and start watching. Well, then all your automatic mechanisms kick in and you stop being awkward. It's also the place you get all the information. 

That's why it's useful to have discussions with your enemies. Because they will tell you things you do not know and that's such a great thing. Because if you don't know them well, you're not very smart. 



### The Reason for Almost All Mental Illnesses

Let's talk about the complexity problem.  In some sense, it is  a fundamental problem. And the reason for that is because sometimes people's lives become so complex that they'd rather be dead. And the reason they seek death through suicide is to make the complexity go away. **The complexity causes suffering**.

That can happen, if you're hit by three or four catastrophes at the same time. Maybe you have the political system collapses, there's hyperinflation, you lose your job, and you have someone that you love or two people die, and maybe you get cancer, something like that. Those things happen to people, and they just think, well, there's no getting out of this, it's just too much.

There's this old idea, a sort of a metaphor for genetic susceptibility. Take a balloon and blow it up until it's beyond its tolerance - it's going to blow out at the weakest point. That's sort of what a genetic susceptibility is.  If I just keep adding complexity on top of you, at some point you'll blow out at your weakest point.
Maybe you'll get physiologically ill, maybe you'll start drinking, maybe you'll develop an anxiety disorder, maybe you'll get OCD, maybe you'll get depressed.  Whatever, they'll be something about you, that's the weakest point.
